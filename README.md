# PID-Helicopter

ECE287 Final Project for Dr. Jamieson's section B
#### Creators: Cole Hengstebeck ('22) & Owen Hardy ('22)

## Project Description
Our project implements a VGA output which displays a graphic of a helicopter which changes position through a PID algorthim to match the y-position of a shiftable horizontal setpoint.

## Background Information

For our project we wanted to implement some sort of control system that would change the physical state of something in the real world.  Limited to a Cyclone II board, the closest thing to a physical output we could achieve within the timeline of the project was the VGA output.  As per Dr. Jamiesons recommendation, we decided to implement a PID algorthim.  We specificially wanted to control the position of a helicopter with a coordianate setpoint.
